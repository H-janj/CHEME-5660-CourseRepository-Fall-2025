    "> __Binomial Lattice Model__: A binomial lattice model assumes that at each time step, the asset can either move up by a factor $u$ with a probability $p$ or down by a factor $d$ with probability $(1-p)$, creating a tree-like structure of possible future prices. At time $t\\geq{0}$ there will be $t+1$ possible prices. \n",
